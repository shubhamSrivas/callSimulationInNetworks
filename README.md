# callSimulationInNetworks
This is a project which contains the simulation of call arrival, holding in nfsNetTopology and panEuropeanTopology. The bandwidth assignment has been done using principles of first fit, first last fit and exact fit. Amongst them exact fit gives the best spectrum efficiency and least blocking probability.
